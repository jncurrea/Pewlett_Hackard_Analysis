# Pewlett Hackard Analysis
## Overview
The goal of this project is to submit two deliverables for a manager in the Pewlett Hackard company. The deliverables are the following:
- Determine the number of retiring employees per title
- Identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program
### Tools
- PostgreSQL
- pgAdmin
## Results
- For the first deliverable, notice how Senior Engineers and Senior Staff members are the ones with the largest number of employees soon to retire. There are 25916 Senior Engineers and 24926 engineers close to retirement.
- For the second deliverable, we get a table with the employee number, full name, and title of those employees eligible for a mentorship program.
- The result for both deliverables can be seen below.
